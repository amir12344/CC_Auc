## Buyer Preferences System

### Memory ID: 3225063

**Title:** Buyer Preference Progress Removal
**Content:** Removed step counter and percentage progress from BuyerPreferencePopup.tsx. Deleted Progress import, progress calculation, and progress bar section. Also deleted unused StepIndicator.tsx component and removed calculateProgress function from usePreferenceData.ts hook. Popup now shows only title without step counting.

### Memory ID: 3225052

**Title:** Buyer Preference Progress Tracking Cleanup
**Content:** Removed step counter and percentage progress tracking from BuyerPreferencePopup.tsx component. Deleted Progress import, progress calculation variable, and entire progress bar section from header. Also cleaned up unused progress-related code: deleted StepIndicator.tsx component, removed calculateProgress function and completionPercentage from usePreferenceData.ts hook. The popup now shows only the title without step counting or progress visualization.

### Memory ID: 3223418

**Title:** BrandsStep.tsx Import Fix
**Content:** Fixed linter error in BrandsStep.tsx where Brand type was being imported from buyerPreferenceService but wasn't exported there. Moved Brand type import to the correct location in ../../types/preferences where it's actually defined. Function imports (getAllBrands) remain in service file, type imports (Brand, StepComponentProps) now correctly imported from types file.

### Memory ID: 3202436

**Title:** Buyer Preferences Infinite Loop Fix
**Content:** Fixed critical infinite loop where getBuyerPreferences was called repeatedly. Problem was circular dependencies in useCallback - checkExistingPreferences depended on isCheckingPreferences, causing re-renders and retriggering effects. Solution: Used useRef(false) for hasTriggeredRef to track calls without re-renders, inlined API call in triggerPopupForBuyer, simplified dependency array to only isCheckingPreferences. This prevents multiple API calls while maintaining functionality.

### Memory ID: 3128195

**Title:** Buyer Preferences Brand Selection Fix
**Content:** Fixed buyer preferences not showing selected brands and listing types. Added preferred_brand_ids to API query and updated transformation functions to properly map API response to UI components.

### Memory ID: 3128188

**Title:** Buyer Preferences Listing Types Fix
**Content:** Fixed issue where listing types and brands weren't being selected in buyer preferences page. Added preferred_brand_ids to API query, updated BuyerPreferencesApiResponseData type to include preferred_brand_ids field, and updated transformApiPreferencesToLocal function to map apiPrefs.preferredBrandIds to brands array. The API response already contained the data, but transformation functions weren't mapping it correctly.

### Memory ID: 3128178

**Title:** Buyer Preferences API Query Enhancement
**Content:** Fixed issue where listing types and brands weren't being selected on buyer preferences page. The problem was that the buyer preferences API query wasn't including the preferred_brand_ids field, and the transformation function wasn't mapping brand IDs correctly. Fixed by: 1) Adding preferred_brand_ids to the select query in getBuyerPreferences, 2) Updating BuyerPreferencesApiResponseData type to include preferred_brand_ids field, 3) Updating transformApiPreferencesToLocal function to map apiPrefs.preferredBrandIds to brands array instead of empty array, 4) Updated transformApiResponseToBuyerPreferences to include preferredBrandIds field. The API response already contained listing_type_preferences and buyer_segments data, so the transformation functions now properly map this data to the UI components.

### Memory ID: 3127753

**Title:** Buyer Profile Preferences Type Fix
**Content:** Fixed critical bug where buyer_profile_preferences was typed as object but API returns it as Array. Updated type definition to Array structure and modified transform function to access first array element. This was causing empty preferences display despite API returning data.

### Memory ID: 3127608

**Title:** Buyer Profile Preferences Mapping Fix
**Content:** Fixed issue where buyer_profile_preferences from API was not properly mapped to preferences page. Updated transformApiPreferencesToLocal to handle GetBuyerPreferenceApiRequest format correctly.

### Memory ID: 3127599

**Title:** Buyer Profile Preferences Array Structure Fix
**Content:** Fixed critical bug where buyer_profile_preferences was defined as object but API returns it as an array. Updated BuyerPreferencesApiResponseData type to reflect Array structure and modified transformApiResponseToBuyerPreferences to access prefs[0] instead of prefs directly. This was causing all API data to be lost during transformation, resulting in empty preferences display. Console.log showed buyer_profile_preferences as Array(1) but code was treating it as object. Now properly extracts data from first array element to populate preferences page.

## Error Handling & UI Patterns

### Memory ID: 3219532

**Title:** CatalogDisplay AlertDialog Pattern
**Content:** Updated CatalogDisplay.tsx error handling to use AlertDialog pattern consistent with OfferSummarySheet.tsx and AuctionBiddingArea.tsx. Replaced toast notifications with AlertDialog state management using alertOpen, alertType, alertMessage state variables and handleAlertClose callback. This ensures consistent error/success messaging UX across all components in the codebase instead of mixing toast and dialog patterns.

### Memory ID: 3219219

**Title:** CatalogDisplay Buy All Functionality Fix
**Content:** Fixed Buy All functionality in CatalogDisplay.tsx by: 1) Adding products prop to receive same enhanced products data as CatalogProductsList.tsx, 2) Updated CatalogDetailClient.tsx to create allEnhancedProducts using transformCatalogProductToEnhanced (same as CatalogProductsTable), 3) Reduced complexity by extracting helper functions (transformProductsToApiFormat, handleApiResponse), 4) Fixed "No Products Available" error by ensuring enhanced products are properly passed from parent component, 5) Buy All now uses exact same data transformation as working "Add All" button but calls API directly instead of adding to Redux cart.

### Memory ID: 3216233

**Title:** CatalogDisplay Comprehensive Fix
**Content:** Fixed Buy All functionality in CatalogDisplay.tsx by: 1) Adding products prop to receive same enhanced products data as CatalogProductsList.tsx, 2) Updated CatalogDetailClient.tsx to create allEnhancedProducts using transformCatalogProductToEnhanced (same as CatalogProductsTable), 3) Reduced complexity by extracting helper functions (transformProductsToApiFormat, handleApiResponse), 4) Fixed "No Products Available" error by ensuring enhanced products are properly passed from parent component, 5) Buy All now uses exact same data transformation as working "Add All" button but calls API directly instead of adding to Redux cart, 6) Updated error handling to use AlertDialog pattern (consistent with OfferSummarySheet.tsx and AuctionBiddingArea.tsx) instead of toast notifications for better UX consistency across the codebase.

### Memory ID: 3211705

**Title:** Centralized Error Handling Implementation
**Content:** Implemented centralized error handling utilities in src/utils/error-utils.ts with dynamic error title generation, comprehensive sensitive data filtering (including cognito_id), and consistent error formatting. Updated AuctionBiddingArea.tsx and OfferSummarySheet.tsx to use the shared utilities instead of duplicated error handling code. The system now properly checks API responses for success:false and formats backend errors dynamically, ensuring sensitive information like cognito_id is never displayed to users. Error titles are generated dynamically rather than hardcoded, making the system more maintainable and extensible.

## Authentication & Flow Management

### Memory ID: 3000860

**Title:** Authentication Flow Comprehensive Fix
**Content:** Comprehensive authentication flow fix implemented with focus on resumed buyer certificate flow: 1) Enhanced confirm page with autoSignIn delays/retries for normal flows, broadened error handling to always use fallback for resumed flows, and proper API calls in all scenarios. 2) Fixed login page certificate redirect by decoding nested URL parameters before re-encoding, clearing needsCertificate flag BEFORE redirect to prevent loops, and adding session-ready wait logic. 3) Key fix: clearNeedsCertificate() must be called BEFORE router.push in checkAndRedirectForCertificate to prevent the flag from persisting and causing redirect loops. 4) Enhanced certificate page auth guards to handle session propagation timing. Normal flows (Signup → OTP → Dashboard/Certificate) and resumed flows (abandon OTP → Login → OTP → Login → Certificate) both work correctly with proper API calls and no nested URL encoding issues.

### Memory ID: 2997701

**Title:** OTP Confirmation Flow Phase 6
**Content:** Phase 6 of OTP confirmation flow successfully implemented: auto-resend with duplicate prevention, 60s countdown timer, certificate flow for buyers, enhanced error handling, and login integration with justConfirmed support. All major functionality complete, only minor complexity warning remains.

### Memory ID: 2997692

**Title:** Authentication Flow Complete Fix
**Content:** Authentication flow completely fixed with systematic approach: 1) Simplified confirm page by extracting helper functions - auto-sign-in now works reliably, better error handling, and proper flow detection; 2) Fixed login page certificate logic - simplified certificate checking function that properly redirects buyers to certificate upload when needed; 3) Improved flow detection between initial and resumed flows for more reliable redirects; 4) Reduced complexity in both pages by extracting helper functions. Normal flows (Signup → OTP → Dashboard/Certificate) and resume flows (Signup → abandon → Login → OTP → correct destination) both work correctly. Certificate upload logic works for buyers. All createUser APIs function properly.

## Navigation & UI Components

### Memory ID: 3059773

**Title:** Seller Breadcrumb Logic Update
**Content:** Updated seller breadcrumb logic in DynamicBreadcrumb.tsx to exclude "Marketplace" and "Seller" segments. For seller routes, breadcrumbs now start with "Dashboard" as the first item. Example: /seller/dashboard/listings shows "Dashboard > Listings" instead of "Marketplace > Seller > Dashboard > Listings". Only affects seller routes, buyer and marketplace breadcrumbs remain unchanged.

## Data Types & API Integration

### Memory ID: 3108460

**Title:** BuyerOffer Interface Distinction
**Content:** There are two different BuyerOffer interfaces in the codebase: one in buyer-deals/types and another in seller-deals/types. The buyer-deals version should be used for buyer-related operations, while the seller-deals version should be used for seller-related operations. This can cause TypeScript errors if the wrong interface is imported.
