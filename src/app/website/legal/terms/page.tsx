            <p>
              The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute,
              claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the
              subject matter of this Agreement directly through good-faith
              negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party
              initiating arbitration. If such negotiations do not resolve the
              dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in San
              Francisco, California. The arbitration will proceed in the English
              language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration
              Rules and Procedures (the "Rules") then in effect, by one
              commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving
              intellectual property and commercial contract disputes. The
              arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS
              arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award
              rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of
              competent jurisdiction.

              The Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Company
              will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five
              thousand ($75,000) dollars. Company will not seek its attorneys'
              fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines
              that your claim is frivolous.

              the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any
              time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the
              actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation
              of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or
              other intellectual property rights.

            </h3>
            <p>
              YOU AND COMPANY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO
              GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and
              Company are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved
              by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited,
              more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and
              are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation
              between you and Company over whether to vacate or enforce an
              arbitration award, YOU AND COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY
              TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a
              judge.

              ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS

              ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY
              OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If however, this waiver of class or
              consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither
              you nor Company is entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and
              disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 13.7

              either you or Company to litigate any dispute arising out of or

          <p className='mb-4'>
            If Commerce Central fails to meet the Uptime Percentage, to be
            eligible for service credits, Customer must deliver a reasonably
            detailed, written request to support@commercecentral.com no later
            than thirty (30) calendar days after the day on which Uptime
            Percentage first drops below 99.95%.
          </p>

          <p className='mb-4'>To be deemed valid, the request must include:</p>
          <ol className='list-alpha pl-6 space-y-2'>
            <li>
              The words "SLA Credit Request" in the subject line of the email;

          Commerce Central will determine, in its reasonable discretion,
          Customer's eligibility for Service Credits and the amount of service
          credits awarded pursuant to this SLA. If Commerce Central confirms
          that the Uptime Percentage has not been achieved during a given month,
          Commerce Central will issue a service credit during the billing cycle
          following the term in which it is determined that Customer is
          eligible.
        </p>

        <p className='mb-4'>
          All Service Credits will be applied to fees due from Customer for the
          Services; Commerce Central will not pay any Service Credit as a
          refund. If Commerce Central denies the claim, Commerce Central will
          provide the information used to validate such determination available
          to Customer for 30 business days, for auditing by Customer.
        </p>

        <p className='font-bold'>
          LIMITATION: THE SERVICE CREDITS DESCRIBED IN THIS SLA ARE CUSTOMER'S
          SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR THE UNAVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICES.
