# Blueprint: Auction Listings Implementation

This document outlines the plan to integrate auction listings into the marketplace page.

## 1. Codebase Analysis & Findings

The current marketplace implementation is based on client-side rendering of product data sourced from mock files.

-   **Main Page (`src/app/marketplace/page.tsx`):** This is a client component (`'use client'`) that imports mock product data from `src/mocks/productData.ts`. It organizes this data and passes it to `ShopClientContent`.
-   **Content Layout (`src/features/marketplace-catalog/components/ShopClientContent.tsx`):** This component arranges various product sections (Featured, Bargain, etc.) on the marketplace page.
-   **Product Display (`src/features/marketplace-catalog/components/ProductCard.tsx`):** This is the core component for displaying a single item. It receives product data and renders a card with an image, title, and other details. It links to the product detail page using a slug.
-   **Product Detail Page (`src/app/marketplace/product/[id]/page.tsx`):** This is a dynamic server-side rendered page that fetches product information based on a URL parameter (`id`) and displays it.
-   **Data Flow:** The data flow is currently `mock data -> /app/marketplace/page.tsx -> ShopClientContent.tsx -> *Section.tsx -> ProductCard.tsx`.

## 2. Implementation Plan: Tasks

To implement the auction listings, I will follow these steps:

### Task 1: Create Auction Data and Types

1.  **Define Auction Type:** Create a new TypeScript type for auctions in `src/types/index.ts` (or a new `auction.ts` file). The `Auction` type will be similar to the `Product` type but might include auction-specific fields like `currentBid`, `endTime`, `bids`.
2.  **Create Mock Auction Data:** Create a new file `src/mocks/auctionData.ts` to hold an array of dummy auction listings. Each object in the array will conform to the new `Auction` type. I will use publicly available images for the items.

### Task 2: Develop Auction Card Component

1.  **Create `AuctionCard.tsx`:** Create a new component at `src/features/marketplace-catalog/components/AuctionCard.tsx`.
2.  **Adapt `ProductCard`:** This component will be a modified version of the existing `ProductCard.tsx`. Instead of linking to `/marketplace/product/[id]`, it will link to `/marketplace/auction/[id]`.
3.  **Display Auction Info:** The card will display auction-specific information like "Current Bid" or "Auction Ends In".

### Task 3: Build the Auction Section

1.  **Create `AuctionSection.tsx`:** Create a new section component at `src/features/marketplace-catalog/components/sections/AuctionSection.tsx`.
2.  **Fetch and Display Auctions:** This component will import the mock auction data from `src/mocks/auctionData.ts` and use a loop to render an `AuctionCard` for each auction item. It will be styled similarly to `BargainSection` or `FeaturedSection`.

### Task 4: Integrate Auction Section into Marketplace

1.  **Update `ShopClientContent.tsx`:** I will import `AuctionSection` into `src/features/marketplace-catalog/components/ShopClientContent.tsx` and add it to the component's render method, so it appears on the marketplace page.
2.  **Update `marketplace/page.tsx`:** I will import the auction data in `src/app/marketplace/page.tsx` and pass it down as a prop if necessary, following the existing pattern for other product types. For simplicity in this first iteration, the `AuctionSection` might fetch its own data directly.

### Task 5: Create the Auction Detail Page

1.  **Create Page File:** Create a new file at `src/app/marketplace/auction/[id]/page.tsx`.
2.  **Implement Server Component:** This will be a server component that receives `params` containing the auction `id`.
3.  **Fetch Auction Data:** It will import the mock auction data from `src/mocks/auctionData.ts` and find the specific auction by its `id`. If not found, it will show a `notFound()` page.
4.  **Display Auction Details:** It will render a simple view with the details of the selected auction, including title, description, image, and current bid. I will create a simple client component `AuctionDetailClient.tsx` for this, similar to `ProductDetailClient.tsx`.

This plan will allow for a clean and scalable integration of auction listings into the existing marketplace structure.

## 8. Phase 2: Auction Detail Page Enhancement Plan

This section outlines the plan to significantly enhance the auction detail page by incorporating detailed sections for bidding, product manifest, item specifics, and shipping information. The design will prioritize a clean, professional, and user-friendly layout, surpassing the provided competitor examples while adhering to our existing UI/UX standards.

### 8.1. Project Goals
- **Enhance User Experience:** Provide buyers with all necessary information in a clearly organized and accessible format.
- **Modular Architecture:** Build each new section as a distinct, reusable React component.
- **Code Quality:** Adhere to enterprise-level coding standards, including TypeScript, Next.js 15+ best practices, performance optimizations, and comprehensive JSDoc comments as you requested.
- **Future-Proofing:** Create a structure that is easy to connect to backend APIs when they become available.

### 8.2. Refactoring and File Organization

To improve scalability and organization, as you suggested, all auction-related features will be consolidated into a dedicated `features` directory.

**New Directory Structure:** `src/features/auctions/`

This new directory will house all components, data, types, and utility functions related to auctions.

**Files to be Moved:**
-   `src/mocks/auctionData.ts` -> `src/features/auctions/data/auctionData.ts`
-   `src/utils/auction-utils.ts` -> `src/features/auctions/utils/auction-utils.ts`
-   `src/features/marketplace-catalog/components/AuctionCard.tsx` -> `src/features/auctions/components/AuctionCard.tsx`
-   `src/features/marketplace-catalog/components/sections/AuctionSection.tsx` -> `src/features/auctions/components/AuctionSection.tsx`
-   `src/app/marketplace/auction/[id]/AuctionDetailClient.tsx` -> `src/features/auctions/components/AuctionDetailClient.tsx`
-   The `Auction` type will also be moved from the global `src/types/index.ts` to a more local `src/features/auctions/types/index.ts`.

This refactoring creates a self-contained module for all things "auction," making the codebase cleaner and easier to navigate for developers.

### 8.3. New Component Implementation Plan

The auction detail page will be composed of several new, modular components:

1.  **`AuctionBiddingArea.tsx`**: This will be the main interaction component.
    -   Displays title, location, current bid, and number of bids.
    -   Includes an input field for placing a new bid.
    -   Shows additional charges (like B-Stock Fee) and calculated shipping costs.
    -   Displays auction closing date and a countdown timer.
    -   Provides "Manifest" and "Add to Watchlist" buttons.
    -   **Note:** The "Bid Now" button will be present, but the "Buy Now" functionality will be excluded as requested.

2.  **`AuctionGallery.tsx`**: A dedicated component to manage the display of auction images.
    -   Shows a primary image and a set of clickable thumbnails.
    -   Handles image enlargement/lightbox functionality.

3.  **`AuctionManifest.tsx`**: A component to display the auction's manifest.
    -   Will feature a header with an informational alert message.
    -   Includes filter chips (e.g., "Full Manifest", "Product class").
    -   Contains a data table to display manifest items. For now, this will be populated with **dummy data** from our mock data file.
    -   A "Download Full Manifest" button will be included, representing where the future XLS file download functionality will go.

4.  **`AuctionDetailsAccordion.tsx`**: A component using an accordion UI to neatly organize detailed information into collapsible sections.
    -   **Details Section:** Displays key-value pairs for `DESCRIPTION`, `CONDITION`, `QUANTITY`, `EXT. RETAIL`, etc.
    -   **Shipping Section:** Displays key-value pairs for `SHIPPING TYPE`, `SHIP FROM`, `FREIGHT TYPE`, `ESTIMATED WEIGHT`, etc.
    -   This modular approach keeps the page from becoming too cluttered while ensuring all information is readily available.

### 8.4. Data Model Enhancement

The `Auction` type and the corresponding mock data in `src/features/auctions/data/auctionData.ts` will be expanded to include new fields required by these components, such as:
-   `location: string`
-   `additionalCharges: number`
-   `manifest: ManifestItem[]` (with a new `ManifestItem` type)
-   `details: Record<string, string>`
-   `shippingInfo: Record<string, string>`
-   `images: string[]`

### 8.5. Task Breakdown for Phase 2

This implementation will be broken down into the following tasks:

-   **Task 6: Refactor Auction-Related Files:**
    -   Create the `src/features/auctions` directory structure.
    -   Move all existing auction-related files to their new locations.
    -   Update all import/export paths across the application to reflect these changes.

-   **Task 7: Enhance Auction Mock Data:**
    -   Update the `Auction` type definition in `src/features/auctions/types/index.ts`.
    -   Expand `src/features/auctions/data/auctionData.ts` with detailed data for each of the 6 auction listings to populate the new UI components.

-   **Task 8: Develop New UI Components:**
    -   Create `AuctionGallery.tsx`.
    -   Create `AuctionBiddingArea.tsx`.
    -   Create `AuctionManifest.tsx` (with a dummy data table).
    -   Create `AuctionDetailsAccordion.tsx`.
    -   Ensure all new components are fully responsive, accessible, and include JSDoc comments.

-   **Task 9: Integrate Components into `AuctionDetailClient.tsx`:**
    -   Refactor `AuctionDetailClient.tsx` to serve as a layout container.
    -   Arrange the new components (`AuctionGallery`, `AuctionBiddingArea`, `AuctionManifest`, `AuctionDetailsAccordion`) into a two-column layout, similar to the product detail page, for a professional and consistent look.

-   **Task 10: Final Review and Polish:**
    -   Thoroughly test the new auction detail page across different screen sizes.
    -   Review code for quality, performance, and adherence to project standards.
    -   Ensure all "go back" navigation and breadcrumbs work correctly with the new structure.
