# Commerce Central Features Refactoring Tracking

## 🎯 Refactoring Objectives

Based on user feedback:
- ✅ Keep "website" as is (not "website-marketing")
- ✅ No route groups like (website) - maintain current app structure
- ✅ Messages should be under buyer feature (buyer-specific)
- ✅ Start with features folder first
- ✅ Cover ALL existing files during refactoring

## 📋 Current Features Structure Analysis

### Existing Features (Before Refactoring):
```
src/features/
├── auth/                   # ❌ BROKEN - store files at root
├── build-offer/           # ❌ POOR NAMING - should be offer-management  
├── buyer/                 # ❌ INCOMPLETE - missing messaging
├── home/                  # ❌ SHOULD MERGE with shop → marketplace-catalog
├── offer/                 # ❌ DUPLICATE with build-offer
├── product/               # ❌ SHOULD BE product-details
├── seller/                # ✅ Keep as is (future development)
├── shop/                  # ❌ SHOULD MERGE with home → marketplace-catalog
└── website/               # ✅ Keep as is per user request
```

## 🗂️ New Features Structure (Target)

### Target Structure:
```
src/features/

├── marketplace-catalog/   # Merged from home + shop + product discovery
├── offer-management/      # Merged from build-offer + offer
├── product-details/       # Renamed from product + enhanced
├── seller/               # Keep as is
