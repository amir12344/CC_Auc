# Google Search Console Fixes - Early Access URL Issue

## Problem
Google is showing incorrect URLs with "/Early Access" paths instead of the correct website URLs for your pages.

## Root Cause
- Google previously indexed early access URLs
- Missing canonical URLs allowed confusion about the primary URL
- Search engine needs time to re-crawl and update results

## Fixes Applied âœ…

### 1. Added Canonical URLs
- **Root page** (`/`): Canonical to `https://www.commercecentral.io`
- **Website page** (`/website`): Canonical to `https://www.commercecentral.io`
- **Buyer page**: Already had correct canonical URL

### 2. Added Redirects
Added permanent redirects in `next.config.ts`:
```javascript
'/earlyaccess/buy-surplus-inventory' â†’ '/website/buyer'
'/earlyaccess/sell-surplus-inventory' â†’ '/website/seller'  
'/earlyaccess/liquidation-platform' â†’ '/'
'/earlyaccess/marketplace' â†’ '/'
```

## Actions Required in Google Search Console

### 1. Submit Updated Sitemap
1. Go to Google Search Console
2. Navigate to Sitemaps
3. Submit: `https://www.commercecentral.io/sitemap.xml`
4. Request indexing of updated sitemap

### 2. Request Re-indexing of Key Pages
Use "URL Inspection" tool to request re-indexing:

**High Priority URLs:**
- `https://www.commercecentral.io` (Homepage)
- `https://www.commercecentral.io/website/buyer`
- `https://www.commercecentral.io/website/seller` 
- `https://www.commercecentral.io/website/blog`

**Steps:**
1. Enter URL in URL Inspection tool
2. Click "Request Indexing"
3. Wait for Google to re-crawl (can take 1-7 days)

### 3. Monitor Performance
Check these sections in Google Search Console:
- **Coverage**: Ensure no crawl errors on main pages
- **Performance**: Monitor if correct URLs start appearing
- **Page Experience**: Verify all pages load correctly

### 4. Remove Old URLs (If Found)
If you find specific early access URLs in search results:
1. Use "Removals" tool in Search Console
2. Request temporary removal of incorrect URLs
3. This speeds up the replacement process

## Expected Timeline
- **Immediate**: Redirects work for new visitors
- **1-3 days**: Google starts re-crawling pages
- **1-2 weeks**: Search results begin showing correct URLs
- **2-4 weeks**: Full replacement in search results

## Verification Steps

### Test Redirects Work:
```bash
curl -I https://www.commercecentral.io/earlyaccess/buy-surplus-inventory
# Should return 301 redirect to /website/buyer
```

### Check Canonical URLs:
```bash
curl -s https://www.commercecentral.io | grep canonical
# Should show: <link rel="canonical" href="https://www.commercecentral.io">
```

### Monitor Search Console:
- Check "Index Coverage" for newly indexed pages
- Watch "Performance" reports for URL changes
- Review "Page Experience" for any new issues

## Contact Support (If Needed)
If issues persist after 4 weeks:
1. Submit feedback in Google Search Console
2. Use Google's "Report an indexing problem" tool
3. Consider using Google's Search Console Help Community

## Prevention for Future
- Always use canonical URLs on all pages
- Set up proper redirects when changing URL structure  
- Monitor Google Search Console regularly
- Test metadata with Google's Rich Results Test tool

The canonical URLs and redirects should resolve this issue within 1-2 weeks as Google re-crawls your site! ðŸŽ¯
