# Performance Optimization Blueprint for Buyer Module

## Current State Analysis

### Module Loading
- The buyer module currently loads ~6339 modules during compilation
- This is normal for a modern Next.js application with many dependencies
- Compilation time of ~969ms is actually quite fast

### Component Structure
- Offers and Orders components are client components using React Query for data fetching
- Both components fetch all data on initial load
- Components render all items at once without pagination or virtualization
- Offers and Orders are separate pages but share similar structure

## Optimization Opportunities

### 1. Code Splitting & Lazy Loading

#### Component-Level Lazy Loading
- **ViewOfferSheet and ViewOrderSheet**: These are only needed when viewing details
  - Convert to dynamically imported components with `next/dynamic`
  - This will reduce the initial bundle size

#### Route-Level Code Splitting
- **Separate Critical and Non-Critical Dependencies**:
  - Identify libraries only used in specific sections (e.g., charting libraries for analytics)
  - Dynamically import these libraries only when needed

### 2. Data Fetching Optimizations

#### Pagination & Infinite Scrolling
- **Current Issue**: Both Offers and Orders fetch all data at once
- **Solution**: Implement pagination or infinite scrolling
  - Modify `fetchBuyerOffers` and `fetchBuyerOrders` to accept limit/offset parameters
  - Use React Query's `keepPreviousData` for smooth transitions
  - Implement infinite scrolling with `useInfiniteQuery`

#### Selective Data Fetching
- **Current Issue**: Fetching all fields for all items
- **Solution**: Only fetch necessary fields for list views
  - Create separate query functions for list views vs detail views
  - Detail views can fetch additional data when needed

#### Caching Strategy Improvements
- **Current**: Stale time of 5 minutes, GC time of 10 minutes
- **Improvements**:
  - Increase stale time for less frequently changing data
  - Implement background refetching with `refetchIntervalInBackground`
  - Use cache keys more effectively to share data between components

### 3. Rendering Optimizations

#### Virtualization
- **Issue**: Rendering all items at once can cause performance issues with large datasets
- **Solution**: Implement virtualized lists
  - Use libraries like `react-window` or `react-virtual` for long lists
  - Only render visible items plus a small buffer

#### Memoization
- **Issue**: Components may re-render unnecessarily
- **Solutions**:
  - Use `React.memo` for list item components
  - Memoize expensive calculations in `useMemo`
  - Optimize callback functions with `useCallback`

### 4. Bundle Size Reduction

#### Tree Shaking
- **Opportunity**: Ensure proper tree shaking
  - Use specific imports instead of importing entire libraries
  - Example: `import { Badge } from '@/src/components/ui/badge'` instead of importing all components


### 5. Image Optimization

#### Lazy Loading Images
- **Current**: Images load immediately
- **Improvement**: Implement native lazy loading
  - Add `loading="lazy"` attribute to Image components
  - Use `priority` prop only for above-the-fold images


### 6. Server Component Opportunities

#### Current Limitations
- Both Offers and Orders are client components due to React Query usage
- Cannot convert to server components without significant refactoring

#### Hybrid Approach
- **Navigation Components**: Can remain as client components
- **Static Content**: Move static UI elements to server components
- **Data Fetching**: Consider using Next.js API routes for better caching

### 7. Preloading & Prefetching

#### Route Prefetching
- Implement `router.prefetch()` for likely next routes
- Add prefetch hints to navigation links

#### Critical Data Preloading
- Preload data for high-probability user actions
- Use `rel="prefetch"` for data URLs

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Immediate Benefits)
1. Lazy load ViewOfferSheet and ViewOrderSheet
2. Add loading="lazy" to all Image components
3. Implement React.memo for list item components
4. Optimize callback functions with useCallback

### Medium Priority (Requires API Changes)
1. Implement pagination for data fetching
2. Create separate query functions for list vs detail views
3. Increase stale times for appropriate data

### Low Priority (Requires More Planning)
1. Implement virtualized lists
2. Convert static elements to server components
3. Comprehensive bundle size analysis

## Potential Risks

### Server/Client Component Conflicts
- **Risk**: Mixing server and client components incorrectly
- **Mitigation**: Carefully plan component boundaries
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test after any component type changes

### Data Consistency
- **Risk**: Pagination and caching changes may cause data inconsistencies
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper cache invalidation strategies
- **Testing**: Test edge cases like data updates during pagination

### User Experience
- **Risk**: Lazy loading may cause content to "pop in" unexpectedly
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper loading states and skeletons
- **Testing**: Ensure smooth transitions between loading states

## Monitoring & Measurement

### Performance Metrics
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- Bundle size reduction
- Module count reduction

### Tools for Measurement
- Next.js built-in performance metrics
- Lighthouse audits
- Web Vitals reporting
- Bundle analyzer (`@next/bundle-analyzer`)

## Next Steps

1. Implement high-priority optimizations first
2. Measure performance impact after each change
3. Gradually implement medium and low priority optimizations
4. Continuously monitor performance metrics
5. Set up automated performance testing

This blueprint provides a comprehensive approach to optimizing the buyer module while maintaining functionality and avoiding breaking changes.
